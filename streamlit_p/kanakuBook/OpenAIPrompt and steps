Consider you as Streamlit developer in python!

Write me a code to create an app that should have a radio button date (default to current date), Farm or Home, Expense or Income, and it should have a text box to enter particulars and amount without decimals its a whole currency amount in â‚¹. dropdown to record whether its Need, want or others all these should be mandatory fields and last field as comments or notes in text area wich is optional to enter. i want all these to recorded in google sheet and create a another tab to show graph based on income or expense, farm or home, with from and to date to choose.



Here's a **step-by-step guide** to help you create a Google Sheets credentials file and set up your sheet for use with Streamlit:

---

## âœ… STEP 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click on **"Select a project" â†’ New Project**
3. Give it a name like `IncomeExpenseTracker` and click **Create**

---

## âœ… STEP 2: Enable Google Sheets API

1. In your new project, go to the **API & Services â†’ Library**
2. Search for:

   * **Google Sheets API** â†’ Click â†’ **Enable**
   * **Google Drive API** â†’ Click â†’ **Enable**

---

## âœ… STEP 3: Create Service Account & Credentials File

1. Go to **API & Services â†’ Credentials**
2. Click **Create Credentials â†’ Service Account**
3. Fill in:

   * Name: `streamlit-sheets-access`
   * Role: Basic â†’ **Editor**
4. After creation, go to the **"Keys"** section inside your service account
5. Click **Add Key â†’ Create new key â†’ JSON**
6. It will download a file like: `streamlit-sheets-access-xxxx.json`

ðŸ›‘ **Keep this file safe** â€“ you'll use this in your Streamlit app.

---

## âœ… STEP 4: Share Your Google Sheet with Service Account

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/)

2. Create a new sheet called `IncomeExpenseTracker`

3. Add these headers in the first row (optional but helpful):

   ```
   Date | Location | Type | Particulars | Amount | Category | Comments
   ```

4. Copy the **email address** from your credentials file. It will look like:

   ```
   streamlit-sheets-access@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   ```

5. Share the sheet (like normal sharing) with this service account email and give it **Editor** access.

---

## âœ… STEP 5: Move the JSON File to Your Project

Put the `streamlit-sheets-access-xxxx.json` file into your Streamlit project folder. Youâ€™ll reference it like:

```python
credentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name("streamlit-sheets-access-xxxx.json", scope)
```

Or rename it to something simpler like `credentials.json`.

---

## âœ… STEP 6: Install Python Packages

In your terminal:

```bash
pip install streamlit gspread oauth2client pandas plotly
```

---

Once this is done, your Streamlit app will be able to **read/write to your Google Sheet** like a database!
